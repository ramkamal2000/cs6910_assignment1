The repository has 3 notebooks. 

1. Fashion_MNIST.ipynb is the primary notebook. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q7, Q9 (Comments) 
It has the implementation of feedforward neural network, and code for training Fashion_MNIST data using it. It also has the code for generating heat maps and for logging all data to wandb.

2. Fashion_MNIST_MSE.ipynb is for using squared error loss to train the data. Q8

3. MNIST.ipynb trains MNIST dataset on our implementation of feedforward neural network. Q10

4. We also attempted data augmentaion to improve the performance, and code related to it is present in Augmented_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb. It has not been fully updated, only the load_MNIST_data is relevant.

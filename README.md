The repository has 3 notebooks. 

1. Fashion_MNIST.ipynb is the primary notebook. [Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q7, Q9]
It has the implementation of feedforward neural network, and code for training Fashion_MNIST data using it. We take the best model and analyse it here. It has the code for generating heat maps and for logging all data to wandb. The commenting required is done extensively in this notebook.

2. Fashion_MNIST_MSE.ipynb is for using squared error loss to train the data. [Q8]
3. MNIST.ipynb trains MNIST dataset on our implementation of feedforward neural network. [Q10]
